This is the PixelPacker project, a tool to pack textures into the smallest possible space, and then print out a json file for their locations.

This project relies on gtkmm, graphicsmagick, boost, and jsoncpp.
There is a command line tool (my favorite), a gui, and a library.
You may also add more algorithms by deriving from the t_pixelAlgo class, and passing it to the library.

To build:
Construct the jsoncpp library in whatever manner needed.
Open the CMakeLists.txt file in the source directory and make sure to revise it so that it points to the libraries.

Then:
cd source directory

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Then the executable PixelPacker are in the build directory.
Do not move them as it relies on being a directory away from the .glade file in res.
If you want to move it, move both the res and build directories together.

This project is currently licensed under the FreeBSD license.
You may look in the COPYING file for the terms(it is pretty lax) of the license.
